# Challenge Oracle ONE - Sprint 01
This project was developed as a challenge, after completing the first stage of the Alura + Oracle training program.

## About
The project was prototyped in Figma, and after that it was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### How it works?
#### Encoder
When entering your message in the text field and pressing the * encoder * button, the application will go through your text character by character in search of replacing the vowels present with the following pre-determined codes:

1. "a" will convert to "ai"
2. "e" will convert to "enter"
3. "i" will convert to "imes"
4. "o" will convert to "ober"
5. "u" will convert to "ufat"

#### Decoder
In this case, the application will scan the encrypted message in search of the vowels, checking whether the subsequent characters are the same as the code shown above. If so, the application will replace the identified term with the respective vowel.

#### Specifications
- Letters with accents or special characters should not be used
